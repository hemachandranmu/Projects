    "Variable naming is an important aspect in making your code readable. Naming variables follow a simple idea: Create variables that describe their function and which follow a consistent theme throughout your code. Let’s take a look at some naming conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiword Delimited\n",
    "This convention is to separate words in a variable name without the use of whitespace. Whitespace within variables is usually difficult for programming languages to interpret. Because of this variables must be delimited in some way. Here are several delimiting conventions commonly used in code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Snakecase: Words are delimited by an underscore.\n",
    "variable_one\n",
    "variable_two\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pascalcase: Words are delimited by capital letters.\n",
    "VariableOne\n",
    "VariableTwo\n",
    "\n",
    "- Camelcase: Words are delimited by capital letters, except the initial word.\n",
    "variableOne\n",
    "variableTwo\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hungarian Notation: \n",
    "This notation describes the variable type or purpose at the start of the variable name, followed by a descriptor that indicates the variable’s function. The Camelcase notation is used to delimit words.\n",
    "\n",
    "arrDistrubuteGroup  //Array called “Distribute Group”\n",
    "sUserName           //String called “User Name”\n",
    "iRandomSeed         //Integer called “Random Seed”\n",
    "\n",
    "- These conventions are by no means binding, but instead examples of how many programmers format their code. Consistency and readability are key ideas that should be utilized in the naming of variables. Regardless of how you choose to name your variables, always ensure that your naming conventions are consistent throughout the code. Consistency allows others to more easily understand your code."
